# The SaaS CTO Security Checklist

[https://cto-security-checklist.sqreen.io/](https://cto-security-checklist.sqreen.io/)

This is a basic checklist that all SaaS CTOs (and anyone else) can use to harden their security. Security shouldnâ€™t feel like a chore. Select your startup stage and use these rules to improve your security. This list is far from exhaustive, incomplete by nature since the security you need depends on your assets.

Please take a look at the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sqreen/CTOSecurityChecklist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.
